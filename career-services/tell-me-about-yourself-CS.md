#Career: Tell Me About Yourself

##Who am I
I am highly ambitious young man! Got a lot of neat tricks and ideas up my sleeves that are just begging to be put into good use. Just the past few months I've completed quite a few very neat projects I'm sure you would definitely find insightful.

##Why I am Qualified
I've been honing my programming skills for the past year or so. Especially the last 6 months through which I really focused on getting the skills that are sure to benefit this company. I've built quite a number of front and back-end applications. Some of them include but are most definitely not limited to applications working with API's, databases, and servers. I've been focusing on javascript mostly as a language. I'm sure I could transfer the logic to other languages though. I like to think of myself as an adventurous soul. I really enjoy fast passed and ever changing environments.

##Why I am Here
Currently I'm looking for an innovative software company that could really utilize my world class skill set. I would love to be a valuable asset to your company and bring you lots of wealth and popularity.
