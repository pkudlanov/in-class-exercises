# Career: Company Research | Tech News

## The 5 companies I chose to write about here:
1. Vernier https://www.vernier.com/
2. Cozy https://cozy.co
3. Slalom https://www.slalom.com
4. Zapproved https://www.zapproved.com/
5. ThinkShout https://thinkshout.com/


## Vernier (**Top Pick**)
If theres any company on that list that I'd have to choose to avoid, then this most definitely isn't the one. Any but this one. Just look at the mission statement. To inspire scientific curiosity, maximize student learning and support educators. That is what I am most excited about. I was even considering continuing my education after the program to get more versed in chemistry to possibly get a job in tech and sciences combined. I enjoy the tech aspect more then sciences but that is in second place and I would love to combine the two. This company just seems to be calling my name. I can even hear it slightly.

From recent news it appears that they highly support pushing tech education on the younger generations. They recently released new software and technologies to promote programing with all the science equipment they provide. I really support that road they're on.

I'm not sure on all the ways I will attempt to connect with this company but I will certainly connect. I think it would be very neat to sit down for coffee with some average joe at this company. Ask them some more about the company environment, atmosphere, culture, and what it's like working for the company. Also ask them if the company lives up to mission statement for real or if thats just advertising. I'll also have to connect to the folk in the company through linkedIn. If I do the previously said I'd have to be well versed on company news and what they've been up to. 

## Cozy
This seems to be a smaller company. All the previous companies I've worked at were all smaller companies. I really like the atmosphere where everyone knows each other. Company picnics are almost like family gatherings. The one company I worked for had a 180 plus employees but they still managed to create quite a welcoming environment. I was on good terms with a lot of the management. I haven't worked at the company so I can't really say if they'll be exactly like that but I suspect they will be since they're a smaller company. I think this place would also be a neat place to find some employee to interview to get a feel for the company. From various reviews I've read about this place, it seems like a great place to work.

What they do isn't as close to my heart as Vernier. That's not to say what they do is foreign to me. They're path is still close to me because I am a quite familiar with the rental housing market. I've got a lot of friends that would definitely find an interest in the software if I landed a job there. I also had ideas that I would love to turn into reality with real estate software. Working at a place like this would definitely be welcoming towards such activity if it gives them more business.

Same as with Vernier I think it would be very beneficial to sit down with an employee of the company for a talk. Talking with regular folk is often the best source of truth about almost anything. I could find someone from linkedIn, other news sources, or social media. I don't know if this would be a company with whom I stay on top of all the news but it's probably worth following them on social media. I would also read up on the general news with them every now and then.

## Slalom
A large company isn't the same environment as a smaller one to say the least. That can be a drawback but it can also be a great opportunity for all the growing opportunities, and stability it offers. I've read up on the interviews for working at this company and they all seem to be mostly positive. It seems this company puts a big focus on balancing life and work. I totally respect that. Also since they are a large company they seem to have a lot of extra curricular activities going on quite often. I'm not sure if I read it right but I think I did. They apparently have their own bicycle team at the company that participates in races. That is totally awesome. I would love to make it on to the team. I love endurance sports.

Another great reason to work here is that I really like what they do and they have a branch right here in Portland. They're a big tech company. Producing tech solutions for anybody and everybody. From what I understood they're not too strict on staying only in the tech field. They also take jobs in other industries so it may be neat to work here and maybe possibly get a chance to work on a very broad perspective of fields. That may be wishful thinking though. Since it is a large company they probably have a lot of smaller very specialized teams so one would probably not get to work on a terribly large scope of things.

This is a company to follow on the news. They are always producing new tech so it's very likely they would come out big things every now and then. That would be a great knowledge come an interview or meetup with someone. I'd follow the key people in the company on linkedIn. Since they're a big company they probably host events as well. That may very well be a great breeding ground for landing a job as well.

## Zapproved
Lot's of people seem to point that the company is very supportive. Really cares about its employees. That is always great to hear. People say even after they were well on there way of working for the company it still supports them through anything they may be going through in the workforce. They are a fast growing company as well with lots of opportunity to move up in the company. With it being fast growing people have said its constantly changing and that does make it a little hard but the company supports you all the way through it all. People also say they are quite good with being very inclusive which honestly isn't something I particularly care about but it may be cool working with people from a very broad spectrum of backgrounds.

They are more in an industry of processing company data, reviewing, and the such. Which isn't something I wake up everyday for but I'm sure it can be interesting if I find out more about it. The main things attracting me though is what I've said above. It seems to be growing, great opportunity, highly supportive, and overall a great working environment. Everyone has great things to say about the place.

Since they are more data driven then product, or website driven it doesn't seem like theres much new news with the company. So I would definitely read up on them here and there about the current news but it wont be the first thing on my facebook feed. I'd follow the company leaders on linkedIn probably. It would probably be beneficial to get to know the companies general direction they're headed and how they work.

## ThinkShout
From everything I've read they seem to be a company somewhere between zapproved and slalom. Not super data driven but still do that as well. They seem to be like they help move the whole software end of any customer forward. They worked with the human society at one point and from what I understood they helped them in anyway they could in the tech aspects of the company. It looks like they take on very large projects with various companies that share their goals and values. I think that is a big benefit that they make a big focus on making the world a better place rather then just making a bunch of money. That is quite attractive.

It would be great to learn all the nonprofits they've worked with and learn all the ways they've changed the world for a better place. That seems to be a big part of their mission. It would be a great topic for discussion perhaps at an interview or another meetup with someone from the company. They would definitely be a company to follow on the news because they work with nonprofits, and appear on the news because of that. It wouldn't be a bad idea to follow Lev Tsypin on social media. He seems like a colorful character.
